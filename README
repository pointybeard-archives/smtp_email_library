SMTP Email Library
------------------------------------

Version: 2.0
Author: Alistair Kearney (hi@alistairkearney.com)
Build Date: 23rd Aug 2010
Requirements: Symphony 2.2 or above

Establishes a direct SMTP connection with target email server rather than rely on PHP's flaky mail() function.

[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'smtp_email_library' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "SMTP Email Library", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

3. Edit your Symphony config to use this extension for sending emails. It should look like the following:

	###### EMAIL ######
	'email' => array(
		'driver' => 'smtp_email_library/lib/class.email.php',
	),
	########

Note: If your server already has PEAR installed, you may need to remove the folder "extension/smtp_email_library/lib/pear" otherwise class name classes could occur.
